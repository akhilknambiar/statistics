# Statistics 
### Code Challenge

The StatisticInstant is the smallest unit. Suppose we get 1000 request in each millisecond then only the sum, count, max and min values are stored.

Later when we take a 60 seconds time period then we just have reduced set of data to be computed which ensures faster processing.

###How to run

From the root folder execute using Maven
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
